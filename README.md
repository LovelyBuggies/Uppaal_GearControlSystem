# Modeling Gear Control System using UPPAAL

## Abstract

In the control system of modern cars, the ubiquious nature of gear-shifting operation has driven us to explore a reasonable and effective method to check the correctness of the model. Inspired by Magnus Lindahl *et al.* , we consider using UPPAAL, a powerful tool kit providing reachability analysis to verify bounded response time properties, to describe the gear controller design. Our experiments prove the correctness of the design without any additional implementation effort to extend the existing model-checker.
