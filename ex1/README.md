# ex1

In the ex1, an introduction was given to help us be familiar with Uppaal tool environment. And we tried the beverage machine proposed in class. We also designed and implemented a light control system as an extra practice.


## About Uppaal

Uppaal is an integrated tool environment for modeling, validation and verification of real-time systems modeled as networks of timed automata, extended with data types (bounded integers, arrays, etc.).
You can find more information on [this website](http://www.uppaal.org).


## Major Difficulties

In this experiment, the major difficulties turns out the punctuation chosen. Question marks and exclamation marks is easy to confuse. Question marks used to represents "signaling", exclamations mean "receiving" on the contrary. We need to think about the model meaning and choose the correct marks.

Another challenge is the declaration file implementation, take care of grammar usage, otherwise you won't run a simulation successfully.


## Files

The beverage.xml and user.xml contains implementations of beverage machine system and light control system, more info please refer to pdf file.
